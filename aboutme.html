        <p>Hey guys! I'm Seth Linares, I just transferred to BYU-I from New Jersey to pursue a degree in Computer Science. </p>
        <p>I'm not new to computers but I'm new to coding and development, so I'm excited to learn about HTML and the numerous other languages this semester.</p>
        <p>In High School I played football and got to the state championship but sadly lost by one point in overtime. I still love sports and to lift weigths though!</p>
