                    <p>
                    The plant known as, Zamioculcas zamiifolia, or ZZ for short, originated in Africa, where it thrived. A couple decades ago, this plant was brought from South Africa to Dutch nurseries and has since been distributed worldwide.
                    These plants are both easy to take care of and has been proven to remove certain toxins such as xylene, toulene, and benzene from the air. Despite the pros, it turns out that these plants have harmful effects such as nausea and diarrhea when consumed by cats.

                    <p>
                        Meowing is the primary way cat's communicate with humans. Aside from purring, it is the most common noise cats make. The odd thing is that cats dont meow at eachother once they become adults. This behavior is only known to be done in kittens at an early age.
