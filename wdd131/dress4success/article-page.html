                    <p>
                    The plant known as, Zamioculcas zamiifolia, or ZZ for short, originated in Africa, where it thrived. A couple decades ago, this plant was brought from South Africa to Dutch nurseries and has since been distributed worldwide.
                    These plants are both easy to take care of and has been proven to remove certain toxins such as xylene, toulene, and benzene from the air. Despite the pros, it turns out that these plants have harmful effects such as nausea and diarrhea when consumed by cats.
                    If your cat does eat from the ZZ plant, make sure to remove the plant material from the cat's mouth, have your cat drink water, and give ice cubes or frozen treats to alleviate any discomfort.

                    <p>
                        Meowing is the primary way cat's communicate with humans. Aside from purring, it is the most common noise cats make. The odd thing is that cats dont meow at eachother once they become adults. This behavior is only known to be done in kittens at an early age.
                        When it comes to your cat's meowing behavior, this typically indicates a need or want. It can indicate that your cat is hungry, thirsty, in pain, or all of the above. A scary thought however
                        is the fact that there are a number of diseases which can cause excessive meowing. Cats can also develop an overactive thyroid or kidney disease and these can cause excessive meowing as well.
                        So, if you notice some abnormal meowing behavior, it may be prudent to bring them to a vet in case something is wrong.

                    <p>
                        While stress may seem like a very human feeling and state of being, it turns out cats can easily be stressed out from a number of factors. Cats are creatures of habit, so any changes to their routine can cause some form of stress response.
                        A big stressor to a cat is often an addition to the family, whether that be another cat, a dog, or a person. Having someone new around can cause attention to be drawn away from them
                        or cause interactions between them that can cause stress. A few other major stressors can be visitors to your house, changes to your house such as furniture, increase time alone without attention, and
                        the death of someone in their family.

                    <h4 class="article-posts">What Do Cats Drink â€“ Water or Milk?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Milk is commonly associated with cats for drinking, but it turns out that water is a much healthier and sustainable option for adult cats whereas milk is recommended for kittens that are still growing!
                        For grown cats, you need to encourage your cats to drink water. In the wild, cats recieve most of their water intake from their food, however today, many people feed their cats dry food.
                        Because of this change in diet, it is important to introduce water in other ways such as a water bowl or a running water fountain if your cat won't drink standing water.
