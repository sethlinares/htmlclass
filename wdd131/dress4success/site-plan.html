      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want to create a website for cat lovers
        To show cute cat pictures and videos to users visiting the site. 
        My website will offer visitors the ability to see an assortment of adorable cat pictures or videos on demand. It will show numerous viral cat pictures and videos to lighten their day. I want this website to be only focused on cats to make sure the user doesn’t have to deal with anything unrelated to cats. 
        This website, while maybe seeming a bit redundant, offers users a unique experience when it comes to cat entertainment. Instead of having to surf through millions of non-cat posts to find a cute kitten, our website will make it possible to see cats on demand!
        For people who love cats out there, let's imagine you’re using instagram and looking at your home feed to check for cats. Chances are, unless you follow only cat pages, you’re going to have trouble getting your cat-fix! This is where our website will come in and provide you instant cat euphoria and brighten your day. 
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will be cat lovers and cat enjoyers of all types. We are planning to focus on a more tech savy, social media friendly audience so around 30-40 will be our range.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Writing:</h3>

      <ul>
        <h4>Why will people come to your site?</h4>
        <p>
          Cats are one of the most popular animals in the media. Images and videos of cats make up a large portion of all created content and searched content on the internet today. In fact, they are sometimes unofficially regarded as the internet's mascot. Images and videos of cats are posted on the internet in an assortment of funny, sad, or cute themes. As someone who personally enjoys and loves cats and kittens, I understand the demand for cat content. I want to model a site that would provide the user with access to an assortment of images or informational topics relating to cats. While not everyone may be drawn to this site, cat owners and appreciators will have access to a website dedicated to their feline friends and have a place to share and explore their love for cats.
        </p>
        <h4>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</h4>
        <p>
          My visitors will ideally see my website as a place for them to learn about cats and view cats on-demand. When someone visits the website, I want them to be able to quickly see the page and find what section they're looking for. If they're someone whos a pet owner and wants to figure out what their cats' behavior means, I want them to have access to either a forum where they can post and read posts or a page dedicated to discussing cat behaviors. If they want to view images of adorable cats, then there will be a section for that too. Overall, I want visitors to feel either like they have learned more about cats or have enjoyed some adorable kitten pictures. I want visitors to come to my site and find a section for education and a section for recreation; it's that simple.
        </p>
        <h4>What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?</h4>
        <p>
          Ideally, my site would include a few sections. The first section would be a homepage where they can see an overview of popular kitten pictures, but also a place where they can possibly see the latest articles posted about cats or even the latest forum post made by a Kitten Korner user. They will then be able to visit the other pages—the first page is dedicated to kitten articles on behaviors, food, etc., and will have useful information for cat owners. The second page will focus on cat media and sharing said media with visitors of the page. I like the idea of ideally allowing users to submit cat media to the site. It will be simple but will likely encompass a majority of the website's traffic. The third page would be a place for visitors to look at forum posts and post their own stuff to the website. Essentially I want my users to complete the following activities: consume cat media, inform themselves about cats, or post to a cat forum.
        </p>
        <h4>What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</h4>
        <p>
          Visitors would not be required to know much before participating in my site. They would merely have to be able to know how to read the articles provided by the site or forum posts created by our users, navigate a website and use hyperlinks, and upload both cat media and forum posts to our pages. Cats are a universally understood concept, and therefore visiting our site would be easy for a majority of English speakers.
        </p>
        <h4>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?</h4>
        <p>
          As of now, there are a number of different sources for cats, but they typically focus on either cat media or cat information. I want my site to be able to handle the needs of both. This is exactly why I've decided to split my site into those three distinct sections. Each will handle a different niche, whether it be the media, information, or forum posts. I think another factor that will be important in making my site stand out is the community I hope to build and nourish. My site would hopefully use its ability to have users share media or post on forums to develop a steady user base that uses my site to communicate with friends they develop in my community.
